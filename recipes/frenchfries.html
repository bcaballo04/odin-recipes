    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Learn how to make French fries that are super crispy with this twice-fried method. I don't think most people realize that any decent French fry needs to be fried twice. The first frying is done at a lower temperature, which softens the potato and prepares the starchy surface for the second frying's crispification.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally.</li>
        <ll>Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</ll>
    </ol>
