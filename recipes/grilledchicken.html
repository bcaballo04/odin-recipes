    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>"Get your grilling skills up to snuff before grill season. For the grilling novice, chicken is a great place to start because it's not as finicky as steak, but still provides a satisfying result. Whether you're grilling chicken breasts, thighs, or wings, we'll walk you step-by-step through grilling chicken so you can be a backyard hero this grills season."</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken breast halves (boneless or bone-in)</li>
        <li>1 16 oz. bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
           
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pound chicken.</strong> The key to a great grilled chicken breast is in the prep. Place the chicken breasts between two pieces of wax paper. Use the flat side of a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound the meat. Don't completely destroy it, but do flatten it slightly so that it cooks more evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate.</strong>For this tutorial, we're going to be using a simple marinade based on Denise Boyd's Marinated Grill Chicken II recipe, but you can use any chicken marinade you'd like. Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel, and place in a shallow bowl. Pour the salad dressing over the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for at least three hours. Once you're done marinating, remove chicken from the fridge and season with lemon pepper and salt to taste. Allow the chicken to sit out for 15 to 30 minutes so that it starts to come to room temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Grill.</strong>Place the chicken on the grill and cover. Cook for seven to eight minutes per side (15 minutes per side if bone-in), or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.</li>
    </ol>
